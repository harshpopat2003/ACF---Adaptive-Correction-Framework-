        "response": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nWe have a puddle of water with an index of refraction of 1.33, and a thin layer of oil with an index of refraction of 1.5 floating on its surface. White light is incident normally on this system. We need to find the wavelength that is most strongly reflected.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant phenomenon**\n\nThe relevant phenomenon here is thin-film interference. When light reflects off the oil-water interface, it undergoes interference due to the path difference between the light reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the oil layer.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for constructive interference**\n\nFor constructive interference to occur, the path difference between the two reflected light waves must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. Since the oil layer is very thin (500 nm), we can assume that the path difference is approximately equal to 2 times the thickness of the oil layer (due to the round trip of the light wave).\n\nLet's call the wavelength of the light \u03bb. Then, the condition for constructive interference is:\n\n2 \u00d7 500 nm = m \u00d7 \u03bb\n\nwhere m is an integer.\n\n**Step 4: Find the wavelength that satisfies the condition**\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\u03bb = 1000 nm / m\n\nSince m is an integer, the possible wavelengths that satisfy the condition are:\n\n\u03bb = 1000 nm, 500 nm, 333.33 nm, 250 nm, ...\n\n**Step 5: Identify the correct answer choice**\n\nAmong the given options, the wavelength that is closest to one of the possible wavelengths is:\n\nA. 500 nm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 500 nm**",

        "response": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nWe have a small coin on a turntable that rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute. The coefficient of static friction between the coin and the turntable is 0.30. We need to find the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the rotation rate to angular velocity**\n\nFirst, let's convert the rotation rate from revolutions per minute to radians per second. There are 2\u03c0 radians in one revolution, so:\n\n\u03c9 (angular velocity) = (33.3 rev/min) \u00d7 (2\u03c0 rad/rev) \u00d7 (1 min/60 s) = 3.49 rad/s\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the centripetal force**\n\nThe centripetal force (F_c) required to keep the coin moving in a circle is given by:\n\nF_c = (m \u00d7 v^2) / r\n\nwhere m is the mass of the coin, v is the velocity of the coin, and r is the radius of the circle. Since we're looking for the maximum distance from the center, we'll use the radius (r) instead of the distance from the center.\n\nWe can also use the fact that v = \u03c9 \u00d7 r, so:\n\nF_c = (m \u00d7 (\u03c9 \u00d7 r)^2) / r = m \u00d7 \u03c9^2 \u00d7 r\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the maximum static friction force**\n\nThe maximum static friction force (F_s) is given by:\n\nF_s = \u03bc_s \u00d7 N\n\nwhere \u03bc_s is the coefficient of static friction (0.30) and N is the normal force (which is equal to the weight of the coin, mg, since the coin is not accelerating vertically).\n\nF_s = 0.30 \u00d7 mg\n\n**Step 5: Equate the centripetal force and the maximum static friction force**\n\nSince the coin is on the verge of sliding, the centripetal force (F_c) is equal to the maximum static friction force (F_s):\n\nm \u00d7 \u03c9^2 \u00d7 r = 0.30 \u00d7 mg\n\n**Step 6: Solve for r**\n\nNow, we can solve for r:\n\nr = (0.30 \u00d7 g) / \u03c9^2\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nr = (0.30 \u00d7 9.8 m/s^2) / (3.49 rad/s)^2 = 0.121 m\n\n**Answer**\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.121 m",

Since the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position, the force is not zero. We can use Hooke's law to relate the force to the displacement:\n\nF = kx\n\nWe know that the force is maximum when the displacement is maximum, so we can equate the maximum force to the product of the spring constant and the maximum displacement:\n\nkx = m(v^2/x)\n\nwhere v is the speed of the object as it passes through equilibrium position.

As the gas cell is evacuated, 100 fringes are counted.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant physics**\n\nThe key concept here is the change in optical path length due to the evacuation of the gas cell. The optical path length is given by the product of the physical path length and the refractive index of the medium.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the situation**\n\nInitially, the gas cell has a certain refractive index, which we'll call n. The optical path length of the gas cell is given by:\n\nOptical path length = Physical path length \u00d7 Refractive index\n= 10 cm \u00d7 n\n\nAs the gas cell is evacuated, the refractive index of the gas cell approaches that of vacuum, which is approximately 1.

White light is incident normally on this system. We need to find the wavelength that is most strongly reflected.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant phenomenon**\n\nThe relevant phenomenon here is thin-film interference.

Since the oil layer is very thin (500 nm), we can assume that the path difference is approximately equal to 2 times the thickness of the oil layer (due to the round trip of the light wave).\n\nLet's call the wavelength of the light \u03bb.

This means the airplane's velocity is 100 m/s north.\n2. The payload is dropped, which means it is no longer moving with the airplane. Initially, the payload has the same velocity as the airplane, 100 m/s north.\n3. Since air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the payload is gravity, which accelerates it downward. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n4. We want to find the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released. To do this, we need to find the velocity of the payload in the vertical direction (downward) and then combine it with the horizontal velocity (north).\n\nVertical direction:\nThe payload starts from rest (initial velocity = 0) and accelerates downward due to gravity. We can use the equation:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (0), a is the acceleration (9.8 m/s\u00b2), and t is the time (4.0 s).\n\nv = 0 + (9.8 m/s\u00b2)(4.0 s) = 39.2 m/s down\n\nHorizontal direction:\nThe payload still has the same horizontal velocity as the airplane, 100 m/s north, since there is no force acting on it in the horizontal direction.\n\n5. To find the velocity of the payload relative to the plane, we need to combine the horizontal and vertical velocities. The horizontal velocity is 100 m/s north, and the vertical velocity is 39.2 m/s down.

For Nichrome wire, the resistivity is constant.\n\nThe resistance (R) of a wire is given by:\n\nR = \u03c1 \u00d7 L / A\n\nwhere L is the length of the wire and A is its cross-sectional area.\n\nFor the longer wire, the resistance is:\n\nR1 = \u03c1 \u00d7 2L / A\n\nFor the shorter wire, the resistance is:\n\nR2 = \u03c1 \u00d7 L / 2A\n\nSince the wires are connected in series, the total resistance (R_total) is the sum of the individual resistances:\n\nR_total = R1 + R2\n= \u03c1 \u00d7 2L / A + \u03c1 \u00d7 L / 2A\n= \u03c1 \u00d7 (2L / A + L / 2A)\n= \u03c1 \u00d7 (5L / 2A)\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's law to relate the potential difference (\u0394V) across the total resistance to the current (I) flowing through it:\n\n\u0394V = I \u00d7 R_total\n\nWe are given the potential difference across the entire circuit: \u0394V = 8.0 V - 1.0 V = 7.0 V.\n\nSince the current is the same throughout the circuit, we can set up a system of equations using Ohm's law for each wire:\n\nI \u00d7 R1 = 8.0 V - V_junction\nI \u00d7 R2 = V_junction - 1.0 V\n\nwhere V_junction is the potential at the junction of the two wires.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for R1 and R2, we get:\n\nI \u00d7 \u03c1 \u00d7 2L / A = 8.0 V - V_junction\nI \u00d7 \u03c1 \u00d7 L / 2A = V_junction - 1.0 V\n\nSimplifying and solving for V_junction, we get:\n\nV_junction = (8.0 V \u00d7 2 + 1.0 V) / 3\n= 3.33 V\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3.3 V",

The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm.\n\nWe need to find the angular magnification of the telescope.\n\nThe angular magnification of a refracting telescope is given by:\n\nMagnification (M) = -f_o / f_e\n\nwhere f_o is the focal length of the objective lens and f_e is the focal length of the eye-piece lens.\n\nWe are given the distance between the two lenses as 100 cm, but we need to find the focal length of the objective lens (f_o). Since the lenses are separated by 100 cm, we can assume that the objective lens is also a converging lens, and its focal length is equal to the distance between the lenses.\n\nSo, f_o = 100 cm\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nM = -f_o / f_e\n= -100 cm / 20 cm\n= -5\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.\n\nSince the question asks for the angular magnification, we can ignore the negative sign and take the absolute value:\n\nM = 5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5",
