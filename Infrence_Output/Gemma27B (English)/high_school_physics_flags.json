Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\n*Intensity \u221d 1/distance\u00b2*\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\n* **A. the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod:** The electric field of a finite rod doesn't follow a perfect inverse square law at all distances.  At distances much larger than the rod's length, it *approaches* an inverse square relationship.\n\n* **B. the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder:** An infinitely long cylinder produces an electric field that is constant in magnitude and perpendicular to the cylinder's axis at points outside the cylinder. It does *not* follow an inverse square law.\n\n* **C. the electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge:** An infinite plane of charge produces a uniform electric field that is perpendicular to the plane. Its strength is constant regardless of distance from the plane.\n\n* **D. the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire:** This is the classic example of an inverse square law.

        "response": "Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Tension, Wave Speed, and Wavelength**\n\n* **Wave speed (v)** on a string is determined by the tension (T) in the string and its linear mass density (\u03bc): \n   *  v = \u221a(T/\u03bc)\n\n* **Wavelength (\u03bb)**, frequency (f), and wave speed (v) are related by the following equation:\n   * v = f\u03bb\n\n**2. Analyze the Effect of Increased Tension**\n\n* When the tension in the string is increased, the wave speed (v) increases (since v is directly proportional to the square root of tension).\n\n* Since the frequency (f) of the generator remains constant at 100 Hz, and wave speed (v) increases, the wavelength (\u03bb) must also increase to satisfy the equation v = f\u03bb.\n\n**3. Determine the Answer**\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be **greater** than the wavelength of the original standing waves.\n\n\n\n**Correct Answer:** **B.

Since both gases are at the same temperature, they have the same average kinetic energy.\n\n* **Force and Pressure:** The force exerted by a gas on its container is due to the collisions of the gas molecules with the walls. This force, distributed over the area of the container walls, is what we call pressure.\n\n* **Density:** Density is mass per unit volume. Hydrogen (H\u2082) has a much lower molar mass than nitrogen (N\u2082). Since they are at the same temperature and pressure, hydrogen will have a lower density.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n* **A is incorrect:** Both gases have the same average kinetic energy.\n* **B is incorrect:** The force (and therefore pressure) depends on the number of molecules and their average kinetic energy. We can't determine this without more information.\n* **C is correct:** Hydrogen is lighter than nitrogen, so it will have a lower density.\n* **D is incorrect:** While the number of molecules would affect the pressure, we can still compare the *potential* pressures.

        "response": "Here's the breakdown of why the correct answer is **C**:\n\n* **Understanding the System:** The horse-cart system acts as a single unit.  We need to consider the net force acting on the *entire* system to understand its acceleration.\n\n* **Newton's Third Law:**  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means the force the horse exerts on the cart is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force the cart exerts on the horse. These forces cancel each other out within the system.\n\n* **Internal vs. External Forces:** Forces within a system (like the horse pushing the cart) are called internal forces. Internal forces cannot change the overall motion of a system. We need to look at *external* forces.\n\n* **The Key Force:** The force that ultimately propels the horse-cart system forward is the **force of the horse's muscles acting on the ground**. This force is transmitted through the ground to the cart, causing the system to accelerate.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**",

The area enclosed by a closed loop on a P-V diagram represents the work done during a cycle.\n* **Counterclockwise Cycle:** A counterclockwise cycle on a P-V diagram indicates that the gas is doing work on its surroundings (expansion) for a net positive work.\n* **First Law of Thermodynamics:** The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (\u0394U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W): \u0394U = Q - W.\n\n**Solving the Problem**\n\n1. **Work Done:** The problem states that the work done by the gas is 300 J. Since the cycle is counterclockwise, this work is positive (W = +300 J).\n\n2. **Internal Energy:** We don't have information about the change in internal energy (\u0394U) of the gas during the cycle.\n\n3. **Heat Transfer:** Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can rearrange the equation to solve for heat transfer: Q = \u0394U + W.\n\n4. **Sign of Heat Transfer:** Since the work done is positive, and we don't know the sign of \u0394U, we can't definitively determine the sign of Q. However, we know that the gas is doing work on its surroundings, which means it's likely losing internal energy (\u0394U is negative). If \u0394U is negative, then Q would need to be positive to satisfy the first law.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile we can't determine the exact value of Q without more information, we can conclude that:\n\n* **Heat transfer is likely into the system (positive Q).**\n\n**Therefore, the most likely answer is C. 600 J into the system.** \n\n**Important Note:** This is an educated guess based on the information provided.

        "response": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Identify the Lens Type and Focal Length**\n\n* **Bi-convex lens:** This means the lens is thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges. It's a converging lens.\n* **Radius of curvature (R) = 20 cm:**  For a bi-convex lens, the focal length (f) is half the radius of curvature. So, f = R/2 = 10 cm.\n\n**2. Use the Lens Formula**\n\nThe lens formula relates the object distance (u), image distance (v), and focal length (f):\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\n* **Object distance (u) = -30 cm:** The object is placed 30 cm in front of the lens. We use a negative sign because the object is on the left side of the lens (convention).\n* **Focal length (f) = +10 cm:** The focal length is positive for a converging lens.\n\nSubstitute these values into the lens formula:\n\n1/10 = 1/v - 1/-30\n\n**3. Solve for Image Distance (v)**\n\nSimplify the equation and solve for v:\n\n1/10 = 1/v + 1/30\n1/v = 1/10 - 1/30 = 2/30 = 1/15\nv = 15 cm\n\nThe positive value of v indicates that the image is formed on the right side of the lens (real image).\n\n**4. Calculate Magnification (m)**\n\nMagnification is the ratio of the image height (h') to the object height (h):\n\nm = h'/h = -v/u\n\n* **Object height (h) = 2 cm**\n* **Image distance (v) = 15 cm**\n* **Object distance (u) = -30 cm**\n\nm = -15/-30 = 0.5\n\n**5. Determine Image Characteristics**\n\n* **Real or Virtual:** Since v is positive, the image is **real**.\n* **Inverted or Upright:** The magnification is positive, so the image is **upright**.\n* **Image Height:**  h' = m * h = 0.5 * 2 cm = 1 cm\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe correct answer is **C.

The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.**\n\n   * **False.** Centrifugal force is an *apparent* outward force experienced in a rotating frame of reference.

        "response": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n* **Understanding the Scenario:** We have two charged particles. The only force acting on them is the electrostatic force between them. This force is zero.\n\n* **Electrostatic Force:** The electrostatic force between two charged particles is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n   F = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2\n\n   Where:\n    * F is the force\n    * k is Coulomb's constant\n    * q1 and q2 are the charges of the particles\n    * r is the distance between the particles\n\n* **Analyzing the Options:**\n\n    * **A. The particles must have the same sign of charge.**  This is **TRUE**. For the force to be zero, the attractive or repulsive forces must cancel out. This only happens if the charges have the same sign (both positive or both negative).\n\n    * **B. If the distance between the particles changes, the force will no longer be 0 N.** This is **TRUE**. Coulomb's Law shows that the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Changing the distance will change the force.\n\n    * **C. The particles must have the same mass.** This is **FALSE**. The mass of the particles does not affect the electrostatic force between them.\n\n    * **D. Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.** This is **FALSE**. It is possible for the net force to be zero if the charges are of the same sign and the magnitudes are adjusted appropriately.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**",

Resolve Gravity**\n\nWe need to resolve the gravitational force into two components:\n\n* **Component parallel to the incline:** This component acts downhill and is responsible for the car's deceleration as it goes up the incline. Its magnitude is mg*sin(\u03b8).\n* **Component perpendicular to the incline:** This component is balanced by the normal force and doesn't affect the car's motion along the incline.\n\n**3. Acceleration**\n\n* **Horizontal Acceleration (ax):** Since there are no forces acting horizontally, the car's horizontal acceleration is zero (ax = 0).\n* **Vertical Acceleration (ay):** The car is decelerating along the incline due to the component of gravity acting downhill. This deceleration is the vertical acceleration, and its magnitude is less than 'g' because only a portion of gravity is acting in that direction.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is C. ax = 0; ay < g**",

        "topic": "Mechanics",
        "response": "Here's the breakdown of why the correct answer is **B. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.**\n\n**Understanding Angular Momentum**\n\nAngular momentum (L) is a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating. It depends on:\n\n* **Moment of Inertia (I):**  How mass is distributed around the axis of rotation.\n* **Angular Velocity (\u03c9):** How fast the object is rotating.\n\nThe formula for angular momentum is:  L = I\u03c9\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\n* **A. The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.**  Catching the baseball changes the man's linear momentum, but not his angular momentum. The baseball's angular momentum is transferred to the man, but the system's total angular momentum remains constant.\n\n* **B. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.** This *increases* the man's moment of inertia (I) because the mass is now distributed farther from the axis of rotation. To conserve angular momentum, his angular velocity (\u03c9) must *decrease*. This is why he slows down when he spreads his arms.\n\n* **C. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again.** This is a combination of two actions.  While spreading his arms changes angular momentum, bringing them back in reverses the change, returning the system to its original state.\n\n* **D. The man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform.** This action doesn't change the distribution of mass around the axis of rotation, so the moment of inertia remains constant. Since no external torques are acting on the system, angular momentum is conserved.\n\n**Therefore, the only action that changes the angular momentum of the man-platform system is B. The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.**",

Substitute this into the equation:\n\n*q'_A = (k * q^2) / (2 * k * q)*\n*q'_A = q / 2*\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nTo maintain equilibrium after halving the mass of Object A, the charge on Object A must be doubled.\n\n\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is A. the charge on Object A were doubled.**",

Find the voltage of the battery:**\n\n* We know the charge (Q) stored on the 2 \u03bcF capacitor is 600 \u03bcC.\n* We can use the formula Q = CV, where C is capacitance and V is voltage.\n* Rearranging the formula, we get V = Q/C = 600 \u03bcC / 2 \u03bcF = 300 V.\n\n**2. Calculate the equivalent capacitance of the three capacitors in series:**\n\n* The formula for capacitors in series is 1/C_eq = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3\n* Plugging in the values: 1/C_eq = 1/18 \u03bcF + 1/18 \u03bcF + 1/18 \u03bcF = 3/18 \u03bcF\n* Therefore, C_eq = 6 \u03bcF.\n\n**3. Calculate the total charge stored in the three capacitors:**\n\n* Since the capacitors are connected to the same battery, they will have the same voltage (300 V) as the original capacitor.\n* Using Q = CV, the total charge stored is Q = 6 \u03bcF * 300 V = 1800 \u03bcC.\n\n**4. Determine the charge on each capacitor:**\n\n* In a series circuit, the charge on each capacitor is the same.\n* Therefore, each of the three 18 \u03bcF capacitors stores 1800 \u03bcC / 3 = 600 \u03bcC of charge.\n\n\n\n**Answer:** The correct answer is **C. 600 \u03bcC**.",

Minor variations exist, but they wouldn't cause a 20% difference.\n\n    * **C. Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.** This is the most likely culprit. Air resistance acts opposite to the direction of motion, effectively reducing the net acceleration of the ball. The constant acceleration equations assume no air resistance.\n\n    * **D.

This means they can only cause translational motion, not rotational motion.\n\n**Determining the Correct Answer**\n\n* **Option A:** The net torque on the bar *might* be zero, but it's not guaranteed. If F1 and F2 are applied at the same point, the torque will be zero. However, if they are applied at different points, they will create torques that could add up to a non-zero value.\n\n* **Option B:** This is **correct**. If F1 and F2 are not applied at the same point, they will create torques that could cause the bar to rotate.\n\n* **Option C:** This is only partially correct. The net torque will be zero *only if* F1 and F2 are applied at the same point.\n\n* **Option D:** This is incorrect. While the bar won't accelerate translationally, it could still rotate if the forces are applied at different points.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B.**",

        "response": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understanding the Setup**\n\n* A projectile launched on level ground follows a symmetrical parabolic path.\n* The range is the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile before landing.\n* At the peak of its flight, the projectile has zero vertical velocity.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\n\n* When the projectile breaks into two equal pieces, the total momentum of the system must be conserved.\n* Since the projectile was initially moving horizontally, the total horizontal momentum before the break is equal to the sum of the horizontal momenta of the two pieces after the break.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Motion**\n\n* The piece that falls straight down has no horizontal velocity after the break.\n* The other piece must have twice the horizontal velocity of the original projectile at the peak of its flight to conserve momentum.\n\n**4. Range and Velocity**\n\n* The range of a projectile is determined by its horizontal velocity and the time it spends in the air.\n* Since the other piece has twice the horizontal velocity, it will travel twice the horizontal distance in the same amount of time.\n\n**5. Solution**\n\n* Since the original range was 500 m, the piece that continues moving horizontally will land **1000 m** (twice the original range) from the launch point.\n\n**However, none of the provided options match this answer.** It seems there might be an error in the answer choices.",
